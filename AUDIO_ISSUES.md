# LTX-2.3 MLX Audio Issues — Historical Investigation Log

**Date:** April 5, 2026  
**Status:** Historical notes. The current `main`/dtype-cleanup path has moved beyond this state.
**Reference:** ComfyUI (PyTorch+MPS) produces clear speech with same model/prompts

> **Current note (May 2026):** This file is retained as a debugging record, not
> as the current audio status. Recent LTX-2.3 AudioVideo smoke tests produce
> clear audio, and the old echo artifact was traced to audio latent positions
> being downcast. Those positions intentionally stay float32. Audio VAE decode
> now follows the requested compute dtype; the LTX-2.3 Vocoder+BWE path keeps a
> scoped float32 island, matching the Lightricks BWE precision caution.

## Symptom

- Speech audio is ~40% garbled across all pipelines (distilled, two-stage, i2v)
- Quality is best in first 2-3 seconds, degrades by 7-8 seconds
- Video quality is fine — only audio/speech affected
- Short prompts (20-30 tokens) work better than long prompts (200+ tokens)
- Lip sync tracks correctly despite garbled speech
- Ambient/environmental audio generates fine — speech specifically is weak

## Root Cause (Confirmed)

**The MLX diffusion transformer generates audio latents where speech is underrepresented relative to ambient sounds.**

Evidence chain:
1. Exported ComfyUI text embeddings → fed to MLX pipeline → still no clear speech (rules out text encoder)
2. Saved MLX mel spectrogram → fed to PyTorch vocoder → speech very quiet, mostly ambient (rules out MLX vocoder)
3. Therefore: the 48-layer MLX transformer's audio cross-attention produces weaker speech content than PyTorch

This is a numerical precision divergence across 48 transformer layers. Audio speech generation requires higher fidelity conditioning than video or ambient audio.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Gemma Per-Layer RoPE (FIXED — Backup 0577)
- **Problem:** Single RoPE config (theta=1M, scaling=8.0) applied to all 48 Gemma layers
- **Fix:** Two configs — 40 sliding layers (theta=10k, no scaling, 1024 window) + 8 full layers (theta=1M, scaling=8.0)
- **Impact:** Cosine similarity went from 0.05 to 0.934 at final layer. First working speech.
- **File:** `LTX_2_MLX/model/text_encoder/gemma3.py`

### 2. Gemma Boolean Attention Masks (FIXED — Backup 0577)
- **Problem:** Additive float masks caused NaN for all-padded rows
- **Fix:** Switched to boolean masks matching HuggingFace behavior
- **File:** `LTX_2_MLX/model/text_encoder/gemma3.py`

### 3. Connector Register Handling (FIXED — Backup 0578, not in 0577)
- **Problem:** MLX connector replaced padding within sequence (256 positions) instead of appending registers to extend to 1024
- **Fix:** Changed `_replace_padded_with_learnable_registers` → `_append_learnable_registers` matching ComfyUI behavior
- **Impact:** Correct sequence length but didn't fix speech quality
- **File:** `LTX_2_MLX/model/text_encoder/connector.py`

### 4. Double Precision RoPE for Connector (FIXED — Backup 0578, not in 0577)
- **Problem:** Connector used float32 for frequency grid; checkpoint specifies `frequencies_precision: float64`
- **Fix:** Added `double_precision_rope` flag, reads from checkpoint metadata
- **Impact:** Matches ComfyUI behavior but didn't fix speech quality
- **Files:** `connector.py`, `encoder.py`, `rope.py`

### 5. Padding Trim (FIXED — Backup 0578, not in 0577)
- **Problem:** Padding trimmed to next multiple of 128 instead of exact real token count
- **Fix:** Trim to exact real token count (matching ComfyUI)
- **Impact:** No audio impact
- **File:** `scripts/generate.py`

## Things Tried That Didn't Help

### 6. Gemma Model Swap (QAT → Standard)
- **Tried:** Replaced `gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized` with standard `gemma-3-12b-it` (bf16)
- **Result:** Audio slightly better, video slightly worse. Neither model matches ComfyUI exactly.
- **Note:** Standard model downloaded to `/Users/steveross/Documents/Development/Source Models/gemma-3-12b-it`
- ComfyUI uses `gemma_3_12B_it_fp4_mixed.safetensors` (standard model in fp4 quantization)

### 7. ComfyUI Embedding Injection (Definitive Test)
- **Tried:** Exported text embeddings from ComfyUI's `preprocess_text_embeds`, loaded into MLX pipeline
- **Result:** Ambient audio present, NO speech. Proves issue is in MLX diffusion transformer, not text encoder.
- **Tools:** `save_embeddings_hook.py`, `_load_comfyui_embeddings()` in app.py

### 8. PyTorch Vocoder on MLX Mel (Definitive Test)
- **Tried:** Saved mel spectrogram from MLX VAE decoder, ran through ComfyUI's PyTorch vocoder
- **Result:** Speech very quiet, mostly ambient. Proves mel spectrogram itself has weak speech content.
- **Conclusion:** Issue is upstream of vocoder — in the diffusion transformer's audio latent generation.

## Remaining Differences (Not Yet Investigated)

### Transformer-Level
- 48-layer transformer numerical divergence between MLX (Metal) and PyTorch (MPS)
- Audio cross-attention may weight text tokens differently due to floating-point arithmetic differences
- AdaLN modulation (shift/scale/gate) may accumulate differently across layers
- Audio-video cross-modal attention could have subtle differences

### Connector-Level (Backup 0577 state)
- Connector uses replace-and-sort behavior (old), not append (ComfyUI behavior)
- The append fix (backup 0578) was correct but didn't help because the bottleneck is the transformer
- `connector_positional_embedding_max_pos: [4096]` from checkpoint metadata — verify MLX reads this
- RMSNorm epsilon: ComfyUI uses 1e-5, MLX uses 1e-6 in connector attention

### Audio Token Count Off-by-One (FOUND — round vs ceil)
- ComfyUI produces 502 audio tokens, MLX produces 501 for same duration (481 frames)
- Cause: `round()` in MLX types.py vs `math.ceil()` in ComfyUI audio_vae.py
- Changing to ceil() made audio WORSE (voices super quiet) — reverted
- The model may have been trained with round() behavior, or the off-by-one matters less than expected

### Layer-by-Layer Comparison Results (Same Seed)
- Layer 0: 0.135 cosine — initial audio states already differ (noise + positions)
- Layers 1-47: gradual convergence from 0.05 to 0.945 — transformer blocks work correctly
- Final latent: 0.186 cosine — output projection diverges again
- MLX std consistently lower (0.56 vs 0.79) — MLX output is compressed/muted
- This pattern suggests the issue is in INPUTS (noise, positions) not transformer blocks

### av_ca_timestep_scale_multiplier Bug (FIXED)
- **`av_ca_timestep_scale_multiplier` was 1 instead of 1000** (checkpoint metadata value)
- This made the audio-video cross-attention gate factor 0.001 instead of 1.0 — effectively zeroing cross-modal gates
- Cross-modal attention carries speech information (lip sync → audio), so speech was weak while ambient was fine
- **Fix**: Added `av_ca_timestep_scale_multiplier=1000` to `load_av_transformer` in generate.py
- **Result**: 5-second clips now nearly perfect speech. Significant improvement.

### GPU Watchdog Crash on Audio Decode (FIXED)
- Added mx.eval() inside AMPBlock1 after each dilation iteration
- Added mx.clear_cache() between vocoder stages and BWE stages
- Added mx.eval() after STFT conv1d and conv_post
- 10-second clips now complete without kernel panic

### Duration-Dependent Amplitude Bug (RESOLVED — May 21, 2026)

**Original symptom (April 2026):**
- 5-second clip: RMS 5535, peak 31977 — loud, healthy audio, near-perfect speech
- 10-second clip: RMS 1137, peak 9899 — **5x quieter**, speech mumbles from second 0
- Audio latent amplitude appeared to scale inversely with duration
- Video quality unaffected, only audio

**Workaround applied at the time** (commit `3ce9ab7`, April 13 2026):
`OneStageAVPipeline._channelwise_normalize_audio_noise` was added and called
unconditionally at stage-1 audio init, whitening the per-channel statistics
of the audio noise tensor so that long clips wouldn't suffer the amplitude
collapse.  This made the audio init *not match* the distribution the LTX-2
audio LoRA was trained on (un-normalized `N(0,1) * sigma_max`, per upstream
Lightricks `ltx-pipelines/utils/blocks.py`).

**Empirical re-test on May 21, 2026** confirms the underlying bug is no
longer present and the workaround is no longer needed:

| Mode                                | 20-second clip RMS | Peak | dBFS RMS | Speech burst RMS |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------|------|----------|------------------|
| `LTX_NORMALIZE_AUDIO_NOISE=0` (new default) | 588        | 10687 | -34.92  | ~1000-1600       |
| `LTX_NORMALIZE_AUDIO_NOISE=1` (legacy)      | 608        | 11775 | -34.63  | ~800-1400        |
| Historical-bug 10s clip (April)             | 1137       | 9899  | —       | mumble level     |

Both modes produce healthy 20-second audio with proper dialog levels, no
"5× quieter from second 0" pattern.  The per-second RMS trajectories show
normal silence floors (40-80 RMS) and proper speech bursts (>1000 RMS)
throughout the clip in both modes — no inverse-duration amplitude scaling.

**Why the bug is gone:** several fixes landed *after* the workaround that
appear to have removed the original root cause without anyone re-testing:
- Denoise mask broadcasting `(B,T) → (B,T,1)` (commit `3ce9ab7`, same commit
  as the workaround — but the broadcast fix likely resolved the latent
  amplitude scaling issue on its own).
- Audio VAE decoder corrections (causal axis drop, PixelNorm, weight paths)
  bringing audio VAE to 0.999 correlation with PyTorch.
- Vocoder LeakyReLU slope fix (0.1 → 0.01) and native MLX dilation.
- `av_ca_timestep_scale_multiplier` set to 1000 (was 1) — fixed audio-video
  cross-attention gate factor.

**Resolution in code** (commit landing May 21, 2026):
- Channelwise normalization gated behind `LTX_NORMALIZE_AUDIO_NOISE` env var.
- **Default: OFF.**  Now matches upstream Lightricks input distribution.
- Set `LTX_NORMALIZE_AUDIO_NOISE=1` to restore legacy MLX behavior for A/B.
- `env_flags` field in run-log sidecar records which mode produced each
  output, so post-hoc forensics can identify the regime.

**Why this matters for cross-modal output**, not just audio: the V2.3 AV
transformer has `a2v` cross-attention layers — changing the audio noise
init at step 0 propagates through to the video branch.  Observed effect
on a 20-second bakery prompt at seed=124: character appearance, ambient
prop layout, and speech tone all shifted coherently between the two
modes.  Default OFF puts us on the same attractor as a stock Lightricks
run with the same prompt+seed.

**DO NOT RE-ADD the unconditional normalization without re-validating
that the duration-amplitude symptom has returned.**  If you suspect it
has, regenerate a 20-second clip with `LTX_NORMALIZE_AUDIO_NOISE=0` and
compare per-second RMS against the table above before changing the
default.

### Temporal Degradation Pattern (RESOLVED — May 21, 2026)
Historical observation (April 2026):
- 5 second clip: nearly perfect voice (with 1000x gate fix)
- 10 second clip: overall 5x quieter + mumbles toward end
- 20 second clip: degradation from 7-8 seconds onward

Re-tested May 21, 2026 with a 20-second bakery generation
(`LTX_NORMALIZE_AUDIO_NOISE=0`, distilled two-stage, seed=124): no
amplitude degradation across the clip duration.  Dialog seconds 8-15
produce normal RMS bursts (~1000-1600), silence floors are clean
(~40-80 RMS).  Cumulative effect of the gate fix, denoise broadcast
fix, audio VAE/vocoder parity fixes, and timestep scale multiplier
fix appears to have resolved the original temporal degradation along
with the amplitude collapse.  See the Duration-Dependent Amplitude
Bug closure note above for the empirical table.

### Potential Deep-Dive Areas
- Compare audio latents (pre-VAE-decode) between MLX and ComfyUI for same seed/prompt
- Layer-by-layer transformer output comparison (heavy instrumentation needed)
- Check if audio CFG/guidance scale is applied identically
- Verify MultiModalGuider computes modality_scale correctly for audio
- Check if audio self-attention RoPE positions match ComfyUI exactly

## Architecture Quick Reference

### Audio Decode Pipeline
```
Transformer output (B, T, 128) patchified
  → Unpatchify: (B, 8, T, 16)
  → Denormalize: per-channel stats (mean/std from checkpoint)
  → VAE Decoder: 2D convolutions, 3 upsample levels → (B, 2, T*4, 64) mel
  → Vocoder (BigVGAN v2): 108+ 1D convolutions, 5 upsample stages → waveform
  → BWE: mel recompute → second vocoder → resample → residual add
  → Output: (B, 2, samples) at 24kHz stereo
```
